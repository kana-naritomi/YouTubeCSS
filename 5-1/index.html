        When the time is ripe To catch you in the act Next time the time arrives
        Then You won't slip so fast I'll numb your senses down And Loosen up your grip
        In the foggy light There's Nothing but your sixth With every color in the book
        There is no mercy for a crook Excuse me Catch me a thief Here is your wanted man
        He'll steal again All reason from my heart You got to be quick Take the chance,
      </p>
