    <h1>Definitive three minutes</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>When the time is ripe To catch you in the act Next time the time arrives</li>
      <li>Then You won't slip so fast I'll numb your senses down And Loosen up your grip</li>
      <li>In the foggy light There's Nothing but your sixth With every color in the book</li>
      <li>There is no mercy for a crook Excuse me Catch me a thief Here is your wanted man</li>
      <li>He'll steal again All reason from my heart You got to be quick  Take the chance,</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>take a shot The situation here Remains rather tense With every pistol in my eyes</li>
      <li>This party's over, say goodbye Oh my god Hey, I've been had Instinct is in my head</li>
      <li>Cure me again Of whispers in my heart Excuse me Catch me a thief Here is your wanted man</li>
      <li>He'll steal again All reason from my heart Oh my god Hey, I've been had</li>
      <li>Some beast is in my head Take me again Back to where it begins</li>
    </ol>
