        There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fevered pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
        Finally, I can see you crystal clear, Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
      See how I'll leave with every piece of you, Don't underestimate the things that I will do
        There's a fire starting in my heart, Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
      The scars of your love remind me of us, They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
        The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
