      <p>There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fevered pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
        Finally, I can see you crystal clear, Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare</p>
      <p>See how I'll leave with every piece of you, Don't underestimate the things that I will do
        There's a fire starting in my heart, Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark</p>
      <p>The scars of your love remind me of us, They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
        The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling</p>
      <p>We could have had it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand, (You gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>
