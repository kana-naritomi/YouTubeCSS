      When the time is ripe
      To catch you in the act
      Next time the time arrives
      Then You won't slip so fast

      I'll numb your senses down
      And Loosen up your grip
      In the foggy light
      There's Nothing but your sixth

      With every color in the book
      There is no mercy for a crook
      Excuse me
      Catch me a thief
      Here is your wanted man
      He'll steal again
      All reason from my heart
